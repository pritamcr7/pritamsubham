<h2>Data Structure:</h2><hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()">In computer science,a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can 
be accessed and modified efficiently.More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships
 among them,and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.</p><br/>
<h3>Definition:</h2><hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()">Data Structure is a mathemedical model where we can store data in memory.In other words it describes how
 the data stored in memory</p><br/>
 <h3>Types:</h2>
 <hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()"> Data Structure is of 2 types</p><br/>
<ol>
<li>Linear Data Structure
<ul>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Link List</li>
<li>Stack</li>
<li>Queue</li>
</ul>

</li>
<br/>
<li>Non-Linear Data Structure
<ul>
<li>Tree</li>
<li>Graph</li>

</ul>

</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3>Linear Data Structure:</h3>
<hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()">In linear data structure all the data is stored in the memory in sequential
 manner.It is not necessary in linear data structure all the data is stored in succesive memory location</p>
 <br/>
<h3>Non-Linear Data Structure:</h3>
<hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()">In non-linear data structure all the data is not stored in the memory in sequential
 manner.Every non linear data structure can be implemented by linear data structure</p> <br/>
<h3>Usage:</h3><hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()">Data structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types (ADT), which specify
 the operations that can be performed on a data structure and the computational
 complexity of those operations. In comparison, a data structure is a concrete
 implementation of the space provided by an ADT.<br/>

Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly
 specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,
 while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.<br/>

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize
 the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.</p>
 <br/>
 <h3>Implementation:</h3>
<hr style="margin-top:-20px"/>
<p id="p1" onmouseover="f()" onmouseout="f1()">Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data
 at any place in its memory, specified by a pointerâ€”a bit string, representing a memory address,
 that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record
 data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations;
 while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.
 Many data structures use both principles, sometimes combined in non-trivial ways (as in XOR linking).</p><br/>
